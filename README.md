# Customer_Segmentation-KMeans

**BUSINESS UNDERSTANDING

Customer segmentation is the process of grouping customers together based on common characteristics. These customer groups are beneficial in marketing campaigns, in identifying potentially profitable customers, and in developing customer loyalty.
Kotler and Keller define a market segment as a group of customers	who share similar sets of needs and wants.A customer segment could be a cohort of people belonging to the same age group,gender ,geographical region showcasing affinity towards a certain type of a product,service or price range.

**PROBLEM OVERVIEW

The idea behind this project is to deal with real-life grouping of customers to handle: the search for new customers.
The main idea of this project is to find similarities between people who are currently customers. Then, use this information to advise the bank on how to  find potential customers (people who are not currently customers but have high similarities with people who are).

**Problem Statement

Difficulty in understanding how the various characteristics of the bankâ€™s customers influence their chances of loan defaulting 
Gap in understanding how the different characteristics of the customers relate and how the bank can mine information to streamline its marketing strategy to specific customer segments.

**Proposed Solution

We aim to come up with a machine learning model that can effectively analyze our data and detect whether a customer will default on loan repayments based on several characteristics such as their income, age,their education level and other factors.

**BUSINESS OBJECTIVES

**Overall objective:

Identify potential customers as a result of analyzing customer behavior regarding their income,debt income ratio and their default status.

**Specific objectives: 

Tailor products  and services specific to customers  
Segmentation helps us better understand our customers and their various needs and wants.
Improve our understanding of current and potential customers. 
Address business challenges and opportunities.
Identify and estimate market opportunities
Targeted communications.

**Business Success Criteria

Identify potential customers as a result of analyzing customer behavior regarding their income,debt income ratio and their default status
Building a cluster of customers based on various characteristics.

**Description of the dataset columns.

The following is a description of the various columns contained in the dataset above:
Age
Education level-The level of education of the customers
Years Employed-The work experience of the customers
Income-The income of the customers
Card_debt- Credit card loan arrears
Other_debt-Other loans the customer has
Defaulted-Whether customer paid or did not pay the loan
Address-The residence of the customer
DebtIncome ratio-Is the percentage of gross monthly income that goes to paying monthly debt payments.

**Conclusions

With the help of clustering, we can understand the variables much better, prompting us to make careful decisions. With the identification of customers,companies can release products and services that target customers based on several parameters. 
**The following observations were made :

1. Customers with lower income have more card debt as compared to customers with higher income
2. Customers with lower income have more 'other debt' as compared to customers with higher income
3. Age and income have a positive relationship. Customers above 40 years of age earn more than those below 40 years
4. Experience and income have a positive relationship. Customers with more than 20 years of experience earn more than those below 20 years of experience
5. Low income customers tend to have a higher debt income ratio as compared to those with higher income
6. Customers between 20-39 years of age have a higher debt income ratio compared to those above 40 years of age
7. Customers between 20-39 years of age have a higher 'other debt' compared to those above 40 years of age
8. Age has a positive correlation with all variables except for debt income ratio which has zero correlation
9. There is no correlation between debt income ratio and income, experience and age
10. There is a positive correlation between income and age, experience and debt (credit and other debt)

 ** RECOMMENDATIONS
 
1. Advice the bank to be careful when loaning customers below 40 years ,because there is a  higher credit risk in that age bracket.
2. Advise the  bank to establish  more services that would target customers above 40 years because they earn more and they have lower default rate.
3. Advise banks to encourage customers below 40 years who have high default rates to form group banking(merry go round chamas) so they can self guarantee each other  hence reducing being dependent on debit loans. 
4. Advise banks to create awareness to younger age brackets(20-39 years) to encourage them to engage in income generating activities and reduce dependency on debit income.
